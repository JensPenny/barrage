# Barrage - Load testing for Health Messages

Barrage is a command line tool that allows you to put consumers of HL7-messages under load.
This is useful for testing and benchmarking HL7-brokers like mirth.
It can also be used when writing your own consumer applications for HL7 messages, and to generate some kind of continuous load.</br>

## Features

1. A straightforward method to configure the sender.
2. Pretty good threading (I hope)
3. A simple view of the `live stats` about the messages that are sent to the consumer. Contains `sent` and `failed` messages, along with a `message rate` of sent messages.
